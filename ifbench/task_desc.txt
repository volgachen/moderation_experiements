Your task is to optimize the system prompt for IFBench so that the large language model can more accurately follow the various requirements in the instructions during a two-step generation process.

The IFBench task is: Given an instruction, first answer it directly, and then further calibrate the answer to produce a final response that best meets the instruction's requirements.

The task can be divided into two steps, indicated by numbers 1 and 2:

Step 1: Answer the instruction directly (<system_prompt_1></system_prompt_1>)

    Input: User's instruction + system_prompt_1

    Output: A direct response to that instruction.

Step 2: Calibrate the answer generated in Step 1 (<system_prompt_2></system_prompt_2>)

    Input: User's instruction + the answer generated in Step 1 + system_prompt_2

    Output: The final, calibrated answer.

Your task is to:

    Refine system prompt 1 and system prompt 2 so that each one provides clearer and more effective guidance for its corresponding step in the pipeline.

    The ultimate goal is to maximize the model's ability to follow instructions, ensuring its responses meet all requirements in the user's instruction.

    You can make multiple modifications, but you cannot change the content inside the angle brackets like <system_prompt_1>. The final output must always contain exactly two system prompts, each presented in the format: <system_prompt_x> ... </system_prompt_x>.
