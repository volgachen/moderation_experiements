Your task is to optimize four system prompts for an seven-step retrieval-and-answer pipeline.

The goal is: given an input claim, perform two rounds of summarization and query generation, followed by three rounds of retrieval, to determine whether the claim can be SUPPORTED or NOT_SUPPORTED by the final passages.

The evaluation criterion is whether the true passages are fully contained within the union of the three retrieval outputs (first, second, and final retrieval).

The task consists of the following seven steps. Step 2, Step 3, Step 5, and Step 6 are guided by a specific system prompt:

Step 1: First Retrieval
Input: claim.
Output: a batch of related passages retrieved from the database (first retrieval passages).

Step 2: First Summary (<system_prompt_1></system_prompt_1>)
Input: claim, the first retrieval passages, system prompt 1.
Output: a concise, coherent summary of the first retrieval passages (summary_1).

Step 3: First Query Generation (<system_prompt_2></system_prompt_2>)
Input: claim, summary_1, system prompt 2.
Output: a query that captures the core semantics of the claim and can be directly used for the second retrieval.

Step 4: Second Retrieval
Input: the query.
Output: another batch of related passages retrieved from the database (second retrieval passages).

Step 5: Second Summary (<system_prompt_3></system_prompt_3>)
Input: claim, first summary (context), second retrieval passages, system prompt 3.
Output: a concise, coherent summary of the second retrieval passages (summary_2).

Step 6: Second Query Generation (<system_prompt_4></system_prompt_4>)
Input: claim, summary_1, summary_2, system prompt 4.
Output: a query that captures the core semantics of the claim and can be directly used for the final retrieval.

Step 7: Final Retrieval
Input: the query.
Output: final batch of related passages retrieved from the database (third retrieval passages).
